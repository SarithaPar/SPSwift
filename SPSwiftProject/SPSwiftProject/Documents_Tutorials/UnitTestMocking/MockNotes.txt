Mocking with SPMaster:

- Framework: OC Mock [http://ocmock.org/]
    - It mock objects for Objective-C:
    1. Stubs - Return values for specific method invocations
    2. Dynamic Mocks - Verify interaction patterns
    3. Partial Mocks - overwrite methods of existing objects

Steps involved in project:

1. Create a Protocol - APIRequestManager. It includes list of API that are mocked.

######

- What is Stub? - Stub is a dummy object that stubs out the minimal behavior
- OCMock: used to Stub and mock data in a unit test.
- Data mocked using NSCoder and Decoder.
